# NYTimes React/Redux app with Service Worker
### Note* User notifications only trigger when a service worker update is available by me deploying a new version.  I've recorded these events below.


**Task:**      Make an application that works offline and present user notifications which will replace a service worker if there is a newer version.

## Tech
---
  - React, Redux
  - Node, Express
  - Front-End Framework: Semantic UI React
  - NYT API
  - Service Worker
